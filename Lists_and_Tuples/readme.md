List: An ordered mutable collection of items enclosed in square brackets []. Once you created it is modified

Tuple: An ordered immutable collection of items enclosed in parentheses (). Once you created it cannot be modified.

## Key Difference:

1) *Mutability*:  The main difference is that list are mutable and tuples are immutable.
2) *Use cases*: List are used to create data and modify the data, Tuples are used for ensuring data integrity.
3) *Performance*: Tuples are generally faster that Lists due to immutable.
4) *Hashability*: Tuples can be used as keys in directories, but Lists cannot because they are mutable.
