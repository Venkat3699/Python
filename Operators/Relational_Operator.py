# Equal to (==): Checks if two values are equal.
# Not equal to (!=): Checks if two values are not equal.
# Greater than (>): Checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand.
# Less than (<): Checks if the left operand is less than the right operand.
# Greater than or equal to (>=): Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.
# Less than or equal to (<=): Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.

# Examples

a = 5
b = 5

# Equal to 
result = a == b
print(result)

# not equal to
result = a != b
print(result)

# Greater than
result = a > b
print(result)

# Less than
result = a < b
print(result)

# Greater than or Equal to
result = a >= b
print(result)

# Less than or Equal to
result = a <= b
print(result)
