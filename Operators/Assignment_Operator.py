# Basic Assignment (=): Assigns a value to a variable.
# Addition Assignment (+=): Adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
# Subtraction Assignment (-=): Subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
# Multiplication Assignment (*=): Multiplies the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
# Division Assignment (/=): Divides the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
# Floor Division Assignment (//=): Performs floor division on the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
# Modulus Assignment (%=): Calculates the modulus of the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
# Exponentiation Assignment (=):** Raises the left operand to the power of the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

# Examples

x = 5

# Addition
x += 3
print(x)

# Subtraction
x -= 3
print(x)

# Multilication
x *= 3
print(x)

# Division
x /= 3
print(x)

# Floor Division
x //= 3
print(x)

# Modulus
x %= 3
print(x)
