# Addition (+): Adds two numbers.
# Subtraction (-): Subtracts the right operand from the left operand.
# Multiplication (*): Multiplies two numbers.
# Division (/): Divides the left operand by the right operand (results in a floating-point number).
# Floor Division (//): Divides the left operand by the right operand and rounds down to the nearest whole number.
# Modulus (%): Returns the remainder of the division of the left operand by the right operand.
# Exponentiation ():** Raises the left operand to the power of the right operand.


# Examples:

a = 10
b = 5

# Addition 
def add():
    add = a + b
    print (add)

# subtraction
def sub ():
    sub = a - b
    print(sub)

# Multiplication
def mul():
    mul = a * b
    print (mul)

# Division
def div():
    div = a / b
    print(div)

# Float
def floor_division():
    floor_division = a // b
    print(floor_division)

# Modulus
def modulus():
    modulus = a % b
    print(modulus)
